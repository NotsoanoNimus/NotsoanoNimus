### Long-term Plans/Goals

- 🌱 Learn and apply: [**C3**](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c) and **Rust**.
- 💓 Create freeware projects bundled with love and joy.
- 🚧 Continue learning through consistent tinkering with [my own OS](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/CrOwS).
- 🕵️ Do more [personal security research](https://xmit.xyz/security/) for fun, temporary highs, and lulz.

***NOTE***: I'm currently in the middle of a development break due to a vacation which started on **Sept 4th** and due to a new _additional_ role I've acquired which starts on **Sept 29th**. Progress on projects may be slowed for a little while.


### Current Fixation(s)
- 🚗 Chewing on CAN bus hacks and vehicular networking technology - follow me as I iterate at [FlexIC](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/FlexIC).
- 🔌 Getting savvy with hardware hacking and IoT firmware reverse-engineering (more on this eventually!).
- 🥾 Maintaining my custom bootloader, based off of [MFTAH](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/mftah.c3l) - Are you a tamper-averse human?
- 🧮 Creating a `gnu-efi`-like [UEFI library](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/uefi.c3l) in C3.
- ⏰ Getting beyond the bootloader for my hobby OS project - [CrOwS](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/CrOwS) - [blog](https://crows.dev/).


### Languages
I have reasonable fluency in:
- ©️ C/C++/C3
- :crab: Rust
- 💲 Shell &amp; PowerShell
- 🐘 PHP
- #️⃣ C#
- 🌐 Intermediate web dev (JS/TS, HTML, CSS, SQL, etc.)
- 📊 Automation technologies (IaC, AWS, serverless, etc.)
