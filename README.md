### Miscellaneous

My career track:
```
  --> Tech support
  `-> Escalations engineer
  `-> Sysadmin (Linux & Windows)
  `-> Systems analyst (cybersecurity)
  `-> Framework developer
  `-> Full-stack engineer
  `---> Lead
  `-> Senior software engineer - Cybersecurity
```

Consumed by:
  - A never-ending pursuit of education and curiosity
  - Over-application of ancient software design patterns
  - Obsessing over valgrind reports
  - Applying ADHD braindrain superpowers to cycle between tasks

Whether personal knowledge, Stack Overflow, or some other admixture of persistence and luck, I ___will___ find the solution to a problem until it stops haunting me.
