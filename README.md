### Work

Former infrastructure security administrator turned software engineer.

_Developing_ a taste for applicable architecture and design patterns where merited.

Whether personal knowledge, Stack Overflow, or some other admixture of persistence and luck, I ___will___ find the solution to a problem until it stops haunting me.
