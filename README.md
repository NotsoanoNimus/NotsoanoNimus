### Long-term Plans/Goals

- 🌱 Learn and apply: **C3** and **Elixir**.
- 💓 Create freeware projects bundled with love and joy.
- 🚧 Continue learning through consistent tinkering with [my own OS](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/CrOwS).
  - Started _2024-10-17_ and hoping to bring it up into 'userland' by around 2025-06-01. Stay tuned. 😉
- 🕵️ Do more [personal security research](https://xmit.xyz/security/) for fun, temporary highs, and lulz.


### Current Fixation(s)
- 🧮 Creating a `gnu-efi`-like UEFI library in C3 (in progress, currently private).
- 🤓 Occasionally contributing to [gnu-efi](https://github.com/ncroxon/gnu-efi) itself.
- ⏰ Getting beyond the ramdisk-loading UEFI application for my personal OS project.


### Languages
I have reasonable fluency in:
- ©️ C/C++
- 💲 Shell
- 🐘 PHP
- #️⃣ C#
- 🌐 Intermediate web dev (JS/TS, HTML, CSS, SQL, etc.)
