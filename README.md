### Work

Former infrastructure security administrator turned software developer (for a security company).

I'm currently happily chugging along in my rigorous daily engineering with [@galactic-advisors](https://github.com/galactic-advisors/).


### Long-term Plans/Goals

- 🌱 Learn Rust.
- 👯 Contribute to public repositories.
- 💓 Create helpful projects people will love to integrate into their environments.
- 🕵️ Do more [independent security research](https://xmit.xyz/security/)!
