### Long-term Plans/Goals

- 🌱 Learn and apply: **C3** and **Rust**.
- 💓 Create freeware projects bundled with love and joy.
- 🚧 Continue learning through consistent tinkering with [my own OS](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/CrOwS).
  - Started _2024-10-17_ and hoping to bring it up into 'userland' by around ~~2025-06-01~~ 2025-10-01 (_life happens_ :smile:). Stay tuned. 😉
- 🕵️ Do more [personal security research](https://xmit.xyz/security/) for fun, temporary highs, and lulz. This includes breaking into embedded devices!


### Current Fixation(s)
- 🚗 Chewing on CAN bus hacks and vehicular networking technology - follow me as I iterate at [FlexIC](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/FlexIC).
- 🔌 Getting savvy with hardware hacking and IoT firmware reverse-engineering (more on this eventually!).
- 🥾 Maintaining my custom bootloader [MFTAH](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/MFTAH-UEFI) - Are you a tamper-averse human?
- 🧮 Creating a `gnu-efi`-like UEFI library in C3 (in progress, currently private).
- ⏰ Getting beyond the ramdisk-loading UEFI application for my personal OS project - [CrOwS](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/CrOwS).


### Languages
I have reasonable fluency in:
- ©️ C/C++/C3
- :crab: Rust
- 💲 Shell &amp; PowerShell
- 🐘 PHP
- #️⃣ C#
- 🌐 Intermediate web dev (JS/TS, HTML, CSS, SQL, etc.)
- 📊 Automation technology (IaC, AWS, serverless, etc.)
